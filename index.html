        <p>Nice to meet you!</p>

        <p>I'm Dmitry Jemerov, a software developer originally from St.Petersburg, Russia, now living in Munich, Germany.</p>

        <p>I've spent most of my career working at <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">JetBrains</a>. I started as the lead developer
        of Omea, a now-defunct information management tool built with .NET. Then I moved to work on IntelliJ IDEA and
        IntelliJ Platform-based IDEs. Among other things, I was the original creator and lead developer of
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>.</p>
        <p>I also spent a year at Google, working on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tools/cloud-repositories/docs/">Cloud Source Repositories</a>,
        <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tools/cloud-debugger/">Cloud Debugger</a> and other projects related to developer tooling on Google Cloud Platform.</p>
        <p>After I returned to JetBrains, I spent some time as the lead of the team working on the IntelliJ IDEA plugin
            for <a href="http://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>, and then switched to product management and product leadership
            roles. My current role as of 2023 is the Head of Product for the IntelliJ department, responsible for the product
            strategy of all the IDEs based on the IntelliJ Platform.</p>

        <p>Some of my personal projects include:</p>
